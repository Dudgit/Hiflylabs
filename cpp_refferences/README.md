# Some of my c++ work
These project were written 2 years ago, when I started to learn c++.
I uploaded them only, because I want to show, that I'm familiar with specific topics.
Unfortunately I've lost most of my c++ projects, because I've bought a new computer in this summer.

# Lambdas
Inside this directory I've made 2 projects, to a 2 dimensional linear regression. I wanted to show that I know how to use lambdas, cpp algorithms and so on.

# Threads
Inside this repo I've a matrix class, created by me. The task was, to create a matrix class, then test it's operators. An other task was, to do a paralelled multiplicaton.

# Nagy
This was a "big" homework. It was about, the heat of a lake in different places. There was a given dataset, which I had to work with, create some statistics. The hard part of it was, that there are randomly missing values or false values.

# Automata
This project I just started for fun. Practice some codeing skill. Not much of a big thing, but at least something I can show.  
##
In this semester I'm taking part in a GPU programming course. It is in c++ (mostly) and there are 2 big projects I had to finish. I do not know when, but if they are complete I'd like to upload them too
