# These are my latest work for the university
I have the Data mining course, where we use python to solve some data analysis task. These project were created by me for specifically this course.  


Unfortunately I can't find the description to the task 9-10.  
But I remember them a bit:
## Task 9:
I had to build a model, which can predict on the MNIST dataset. 
We did not had to train it, because the weights were given already.
The first and the second thask said, I had to create it in numpy. In the third I had to build a keras model, by the given parameters.
In task  4 and 5, I had to check both model's confusion matrix, loss and accuracy.

## Task 10:
We had to load the given datasets and teach them to a keras model. Then check their loss, accuracy and so on.
In the last task, we had to imporve it's accuracy on the test dataset, to reach 91%.
I used the test set for validation, because the task said to do so.

## Other tasks
The other task contains their description, so I did not wrote description for them here.
